Lab 5: 
In this Lab i learned how to use mips to 
implement primitive graphics and how to 
code those said fuctions. In addition i learned
how to write macros in mips and how to save things to 
the stack so i could pop them later. I also learned how to
use the mips bitmap to display those graphics by coloring 
indicidual pixels in the bitmap.
